// A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building.The height of this floor, is h.For example 3 meters
// He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces at a rate of br of it’s height for example a rate of two-thirds of its height would be a bounce rate of 0.66.
// His mother looks out of a window win meters from the ground. Example: 1.5 meters
// How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

// Take note of the following conditions:

// ** Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0**
// h > 0
// 3 > 0
// ** Float parameter “br" must be greater than 0 and less than 1**
// 1 < br > 0 
// ** Float parameter “win" must be less than h.**
// win < h  
// 1.5 < 3
// If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer of the number of times the mother sees the ball pass her window, otherwise return -1.
// yes: # of times 
// no: -1
// Note: The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is stricty greater than the win parameter. IE: rebounding h > win

// Example:
// h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3
// h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 (Condition 2) not fulfilled).


function bouncingBall(h, br, win) {

  var seeBall = 0; {
    // parameters
    if (h > 0 && br < 1 && h > win) {
      // while loop
      // while height of ball is higher or equal to the height of the window
      while (h >= win) {
        // 3 > 1.5
        seeBall++;
        h *= br;
        // h = 3 * .66 
        // h = 1.98 = 2 (float)
